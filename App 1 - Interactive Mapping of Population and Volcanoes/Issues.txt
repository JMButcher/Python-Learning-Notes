Issue:
	Originally I tried using "Stamen Terrain" as a tile, but despite being a built-in tile, this seems to be outdated and was giving an attribute error that prevented my code from running. I noticed this when adding markers.
Fix:
	Swapped "Stamen Terrain" for "OpenStreetMap" after reading forums on StackOverflow.
